      Hey Anshu,
      <br><br>
      There are some things I’ve been meaning to say — things that go beyond just emotions. You’ve always stood beside me, quietly but powerfully, like an anchor I didn’t even realize I needed.
      <br><br>
      You’ve believed in me in moments when I couldn’t see my own worth. You’ve shown up, again and again, not for attention, but because you genuinely care. And I see that. I feel it in every small effort, every random check-in, and every time you try to get a little closer — not because you have to, but because you want to.
      <br><br>
      You might not even realize how much your presence means to me. The way you support me — it’s not loud, it’s not dramatic, but it’s real. And that’s rare. You give me the kind of strength that doesn’t need to be shouted to be powerful.
      <br><br>
      So here's what I want you to know: I care about you deeply. Not in a casual way, not just for a season — but in a way that respects who you are and how much heart you’ve poured into the people you care about. I notice, and I’ll never take that for granted.
      <br><br>
      Whatever comes ahead, just know this: I’m here for you — just like you’ve been here for me.
      <br><br>
      — Sanjay
